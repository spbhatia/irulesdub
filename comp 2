### Key:
- **Yes:** Fully supports the feature with comprehensive capabilities.
- **Partially:** Supports the feature but may not be as comprehensive or may be limited to specific contexts or configurations.
- **No:** Does not support the feature or has very limited capabilities in this area.

### Notes:
- **Observability across multiple layers:** Datadog and Splunk offer comprehensive observability across infrastructure, applications, and network, while NNMI, SevOne, and HPNA are more focused on specific layers, particularly network.
- **Real-time Analytics:** Datadog, SevOne, and Splunk excel in providing real-time analytics; NNMI and HPNA have more limited capabilities, focusing mainly on network elements.
- **Customized Dashboard and Variety of Visualization:** Datadog and Splunk provide extensive customization and a wide range of visualization options. NNMI, SevOne, and HPNA offer some level of dashboard customization but are generally less versatile.
- **Cloud Capabilities (VMware):** Datadog and Splunk have robust cloud monitoring capabilities, including VMware. NNMI and SevOne offer partial monitoring capabilities for VMware environments, while HPNA does not focus on this area.
- **Integration:** All tools offer some level of integration; however, Datadog and Splunk are noted for their extensive range of integrations across many modern cloud services and applications.
- **API & Automation:** Datadog and Splunk provide robust APIs and automation capabilities, suitable for advanced IT operations and dynamic environments. NNMI, SevOne, and HPNA offer these features more narrowly, focused on specific tasks or environments.
- **Baseline & Anomaly Detection:** Only Datadog and Splunk offer comprehensive baseline setting and anomaly detection across various types of data, leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques.

This table should help in assessing which tool best fits your specific needs based on their capabilities in these critical areas.
